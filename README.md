# Calculator
Creating a calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is an educational project. Here's a brief description of the project in a list of points:

**HTML (Structure):**

1. Create an HTML file to define the structure of the calculator.
2. Use a `<div>` or `<section>` to contain the entire calculator.
3. Inside the container, create an input field to display the numbers and results.
4. Create a series of buttons for numbers (0-9), operators (+, -, *, /), and special functions (clear, equal).

**CSS (Styling):**

5. Style the calculator container with background color, border, and padding to make it visually appealing.
6. Style the input field to make it stand out and adjust its font size and alignment.
7. Style the buttons with background colors, borders, and a hover effect to make them clickable.
8. Arrange the buttons in a grid layout using CSS Flexbox or Grid to give the calculator a proper look.
9. Make the calculator responsive for different screen sizes using media queries.

**JavaScript (Functionality):**

10. Attach event listeners to each button to capture user interactions.
11. Create functions to handle number and operator button clicks, updating the input field accordingly.
12. Implement a function to calculate the result when the "equal" button is clicked.
13. Add a "clear" button that resets the input field to its initial state.
14. Ensure the calculator follows the standard operator precedence rules (BODMAS/BIDMAS) when calculating expressions.
15. Display the result in the input field, updating it with each button press.
16. Handle error cases, such as division by zero or invalid expressions, and display appropriate error messages.
17. Add keyboard support so users can input numbers and operators using their keyboard as well.
